# Assessment Week 3

### Metaphor of Object Oriented Programming

This week's assessment topic is Object Oriented Programming (OOP). I'm not an OOP expert, so let's just add more fun in this task. So as stated on the title you need to create a metaphor for OOP. Because OPP is so complex, we can try in a way that a 5-year-old would understand. There's no specific OOP topic for this metaphor. You can only create metaphor for object `__proto` or OOP as general

For example you can see how Maggie Appleton think React as potato: [https://maggieappleton.com/reactpotato](https://maggieappleton.com/reactpotato) or think React lifecycle as kid dance performance [https://medium.com/technoetics/life-cycle-methods-in-react-as-a-kids-dance-performance-d567f36c8894](https://medium.com/technoetics/life-cycle-methods-in-react-as-a-kids-dance-performance-d567f36c8894)

### Scoring Criteria

Since this task rely on your creativity, as long as you submit your metaphor on time you will get perfect score.
